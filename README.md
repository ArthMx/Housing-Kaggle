# Housing-Kaggle
In this repository, you will find my two notebooks for the Housing Kaggle competition, for which the goal is to build a model predicting housing sale prices.

- Housing EDA.ipynb contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (it's quite ugly, it was the first EDA I did completely by myself, I tried a lot of things).

- Housing Model.ipynb contains the cleaning and transformation of the data, and the model search.
